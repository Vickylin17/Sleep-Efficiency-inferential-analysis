The purpose of this project is to investigate, to what extent sleep efficiency relates to a set of variables including age, gender, sleep duration, REM sleep percentage, deep sleep percentage, awakenings, caffeine consumption, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and exercise frequency. In addition, we want to explore and select the linear model that can best explain the relationships between sleep efficiency
and the factors.

By generating and exploring multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on these variables, we can offer some valuable insights to guide mental decisions and the allocation of healthcare resources.
